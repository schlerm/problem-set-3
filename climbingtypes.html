    <h1>The Types of Climbing</h1>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h2>Bouldering</h2>
      <p>Bouldering is the most beginner-friendly type of climbing available. Bouldering generally involves rather
         short climbs of 10-20 feet. The safety equipment is usually only a simple gymnastics mat or portable
         bouldering mat if you are outdoors. You also need a pair of shoes, which is required for all rock climbing,
         and a chalk bag. The chalk is to make sure your hands remain dry while on the wall so you can maximize grip.
         Some boulders have top outs, where you can climb over the top of the boulder. Some, usually gym boulders, dont
         have topouts and usually have a set "finish hold" where you grab it then fall to the ground. You can also get
         injured while bouldering if you fall incorrectly, so make sure to learn that before beginning.</p>

         <h3>The Bouldering Climbing Style</h3>
         <p>Bouldering involved a short set of more powerful moves. This is generally different from longer rope routes
           because most rope routes focus more on endurance than power. This is why climbers that specialize in bouldering
           might not be as good in other disciplines becuase they would lose their strength rather quickly.<p>
      <br>
      <br>
    <h2>Top Rope</h2>
      <p>Top rope climbing is another popular discipline of the sport. A person is attached to a rope on a pulley at the
        top of a route with a belayer at the bottom. There is little slack, so the climber never falls that hard. The
        routes are usually 30ft or more and do not have a place to top out and stand on at the top unless you are climbing
        outdoors.</p>

        <h3>The Top Rope Climbing Style</h3>
          <p>Top rope climbing is much more endurance based than bouldering, but less so than sport, trad, multipitch,
            or bigwall. The moves are usually not as difficult as a comparable bouldering grade, but require more endurance.
            It is also very safe because even if you fall, there is little chance of injury unless your belayer makes a
            really bad error.</p>

      <br>
      <br>
    <h2>Sport/Lead Climbing</h2>
      <p>Sport or lead climbing is one of the more difficult disciplines of climbing. It involves the climber pulling the
        rope up with them and attaching or "clipping" them to quickdraws, which are carabiners on small strips of strong
        nylon that act as a pulley if the climber falls. Falls can sometimes be dangerous is the climber does not clip in
        enough and climbs too high above his last clip. The climber can potentially hit their head on the wall because of
        how fast the fall will be. Some climbers purposely do this as a sort of victory celebration. That is called a whip
        because it looks like the rope whips in a way.</p>
