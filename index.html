    <h1>The Sport of Rock Climbing</h1>
    <p>Rock climbing is pretty self explanatory as a sport.
      It is very specialized in terms of the type of fit
      the athletes must be. It is also very fun with a weloming
      community and is very beginner friendly. Also, it has
      recently become an olympic sport.
      <br>
      The sport is rather dangerous depending on the type of
      climbing and is also very mentally demanding and skill
      based. Some types of climbing are more dangerous than
      the other. We will go into more detail on this later.
